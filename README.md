# Lyric API

I created an API of song lyrics to help users generate an instagram caption based on lyrics of their favorite artists.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node

I create a select menu of Artist options and a button. The user selects from the options given to them in the select menu and then clicks the button. Using JavaScript, I display song, artist, and lyrics results of the search on the screen. This API information was stored in Node.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a really exciting project for me. I learned how to create my own API and implement all of the other JavaScript lessons learned from the last couple of weeks as well.
